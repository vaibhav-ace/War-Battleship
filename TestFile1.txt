Assigning random values to 2 battleships on a 10x10 grid

Expected Output: A vector with x,y values, both between 1 and 10
Procured Output:
Battleship 1                        Battleship 2
[9,10]                              [2,10]
[5,4]                               [4,8]
[5,9]                               [3,9]
[5,10]                              [1,8]
[8,8]                               [7,1]

After 30 iterations in the for loop, checking how many hits the player got

Expected Output: For the 30 iteratitons if the randomly entered 'coordinate' variable is the same as the position vector of battleship1 or battleship2, disp "HIT" otherwise disp "MISS"
Procured Output:
Test 1         Test 2         Test 3
