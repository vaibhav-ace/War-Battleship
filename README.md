Important Information

This project was undertaken in a MATLAB and C course at The University of Adelaide. This game program was developed by me independently in the course. Please do not plagiarise the code which might cause yourself legal or copyright issues. All permissions were asked from the Professor before publishing this code to a public GitHub repository.

Note: Game Description

One of the first projects undertaken by me, the game runs in MATLAB. Based on the classic battleship board game, this game consists of varying levels of difficulty including secret hacks, various hints and interesting storyline gameplay. Enjoy the game!
