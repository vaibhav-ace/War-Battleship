Note: Game Description

One of the first projects undertaken by me, the game runs in MATLAB. Based on the classic battleship board game, this game consists of varying levels of difficulty including secret hacks, various hints and interesting storyline gameplay. Enjoy the game!

No code was copied from any other internet sources for this project. This is an independent project undertaken by me, built from scratch!
