If the difficulty of the games is chosen by the user, the number of tries should correspond to the pre-determined number except int he case of "free" mode

Expected Output: If difficulty is easy, 'n' is 60
                 If difficulty is hard, 'n' is 40
                 If difficulty is grandmaster, 'n' is 20
                 If difficulty is free, 'n' is chosen by the user
                 If difficulty is not one of the above, 'n' is given the value infinity
Procured Output:
Easy             Hard             Grandmaster              Free         Any Other Difficulty

Assigning random values to 3 battleships on a 10x10 grid

Expected Output: A vector with x,y values, both between 1 and 10
Procured Output:
Battleship 1                        Battleship 2           Battleship 3
[8,4]                                [7,2]                   [8,1]
[3,1]                                [1,9]                   [7,4]
[10,1]                               [5,4]                   [8,8]
[2,5]                                [5,7]                   [8,8]
[3,7]                                [7,2]                   [2,5]

Calculating the number of battleships hit and storing them in a variable name 'sum'

Expected Output: The number of battleships hit correspond to the sum in easy, hard, grandmaster or free mode
Procured Output:
Trial 1 (60 trials): 2
Trial 2 (40 trials): 1
Trial 3 (20 trials): 0
Trial 4 (10 trials): 0
Trial 5 (100 trials): 3

If sum=3, then we should get a displayed message, "Congratulations, you won against the invading alien battleships!" or else we get the message "Unfortunately, you lost...Better luck next time!"
Based on the trials above:
Expected Output:
Trial 1:Unfortunately, you lost...Better luck next time!
Trial 2:Unfortunately, you lost...Better luck next time!
Trial 3:Unfortunately, you lost...Better luck next time!
Trial 4:Unfortunately, you lost...Better luck next time!
Trial 5:Congratulations, you won against the invading alien battleships!
Procured Output:
Trial 1:Unfortunately, you lost...Better luck next time!
Trial 2:Unfortunately, you lost...Better luck next time!
Trial 3:Unfortunately, you lost...Better luck next time!
Trial 4:Unfortunately, you lost...Better luck next time!
Trial 5:Congratulations, you won against the invading alien battleships!
