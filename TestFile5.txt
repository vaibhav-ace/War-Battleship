For 1st trial (Line 8):
If difficulty is 'free,' and the number of hints are being asked, then if the user types 9000, a secret hack is used to show the co-ordinates of all battleships
Expected Output:
General, after decrypting enemy transmissions we have decoded their locations, as listed below:
[2,6]
[4,10]
[2,5]
[1,4]
[3,7]
